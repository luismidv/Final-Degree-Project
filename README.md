A web application using React.js, Django and a machine learning system.
The idea on this project is creating a web application where you can find people to share a house with,
but making sure that you are living with someone pretty compatible with you, in terms of schedules, music, smoking, interest...

The whole idea with this application is not only creating a service that can help people it is also proving myself
with one of the most used technologies on the market as React.js and using a backend framework as Django.
